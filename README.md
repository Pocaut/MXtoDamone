# MXtoDamone
I really like the track Damone by Deftones, but it only plays at the end of MX, which is 37 minutes long. Sometimes i fall asleep listening to MX only for Damone to jumpscare me. 

This simple python script checks whether MX is playing and if its past the 4:45min mark, then skips to 32:35min where Damone starts.
To use this you need to create an APP on the official Spotify website and just insert your IDs into the code. First time opens an AUTH screen, then it works forever.

It also skips Creep by Radiohead, because i hate it.
